      "description": "Large, deep, spoon-like leaves. This plant is the bigger sibling of the Bird of Paradise you probably knew growing up. Native to South America, it is mistakenly called a banana tree, because it looks like banana plants. Under the right conditions, including: full, southern light exposure, proper humidity and temperature, these plants produce beautiful, orange cranelike flowers indoors, although rare.",
      "careInstructions": "Water thoroughly once per week to every other week, when the top four inches of soil are dry. They do well in low, medium, and high light environments."
